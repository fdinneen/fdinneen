- ðŸ‘‹ Hello prospective reader, I'm Fiona Dinneen (@fdinneen on here)! I'm a 20-year-old Texas resident, exploring the tech world and seeing
what it's like to build my programming skills and knowledge. I hope to document all my current and future projects on here, both as a tool for future employers/collaborators and as a way to track my progress. 
- While I'm clearly at the beginning of my career and not yet entirely proficient at any one skill, I have limited knowledge of **Javascript, Visual Basic, Python, and HTML/CSS.**
